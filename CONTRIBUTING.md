# Contributing

`cloud-itonami-8220` accepts contributions to the OSS blueprint, capability
bindings, policy tests, documentation and operator model.

## Development
The capability layer lives in `kotoba-lang/robotics` and
`kotoba-lang/labor`. This repo holds the business blueprint and
operator contracts.

```bash
clojure -X:test
clojure -M:lint
```

## Rules
- Do not commit real customer or call data.
- Keep dispatch and quality records behind the Call Centre Governor.
- Treat dispatch/data-handling workflows as high-risk: add tests for
  automation-safety gating, compliance scope, evidence, disclosure
  and audit logging.
- Document any new business-model or operator assumption in `docs/`.

## Pull Requests
PRs should describe: what behavior changed, which policy invariant is
affected, how it was tested, whether operator or certification docs need
updates.
